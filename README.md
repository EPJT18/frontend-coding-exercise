This coding exercise is used to challenge candidates applying to work for [Swoop Aero](https://www.swoop.aero)

## Instructions

* Create a React application that shows a Map.
* The Map should display features that mark the different localities in Victoria, Australia (plus parts of SA, ACT and NSW). Use the geojson data in the [Assets](#assets) section.
* Each feature or marker is clickable and should display the information about it. It will be up to you how to display this.
* The information about each marker can be read from the "properties" attribute of the Feature object.
```
# example

{
    "type": "Feature",
    "id": "VMFEAT_LOCALITY_POINT.60252",
    "geometry":
    {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates":
        [
            143.481649,
            -35.237661
        ]
    },
    "geometry_name": "SHAPE",
    "properties":
    {
        "PFI": 1582,
        "NAME_ID": 100374,
        "PLACE_NAME": "BEVERFORD",
        "PLACE_NAME_LABEL": "Beverford",
        "FEATURE_TYPE_CODE": "place",
        "FEATURE_SUBTYPE": "locality bounded",
        "HIERARCHY": 8,
        "STATE": "VIC",
        "SCALE_USE_CODE": "6",
        "PFI_CREATED": "2009-12-31Z",
        "UFI_CREATED": "2011-08-11Z",
        "OBJECTID": 582
    }
}
```
* Make sure to create git commits to give us an idea how you did all the work.
* And lastly, don't forget to write tests too.

## Layout
* Header (add a logo)
* Body/Map
* Footer (add some copyright text)

<em>See sample layout and info display [below](#sample-designs)</em>.

## Output / Expectations
* Provide us with a Github repo of your code. You can set it to private if you want and give us access so we can clone.
* Once we've cloned your repo, these are the only commands that we will execute
    * yarn install
    * yarn test
    * yarn start
* We will review your repository structure, code, app design and it's responsiveness.
* Ultimately, impress us with your UI skills! The general layout is simple. It's up to you to add more value to what you're coding.
